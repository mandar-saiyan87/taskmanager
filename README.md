## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js (Vite), Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, RSuit
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (PERN stack) (Neon.tech)

## Limitations

- Currently not mobile responsive.
- May experience slow / delayed response due to render.io free hosting with limited resources.
- May need to refresh / reload page to view tasks until render.io service is up and running as render.io free service shuts down due to inactivity.

## Future Additions

Will include user authentication and other ideas that will come.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend.
3. Set up PostgreSQL database.
4. Run the application.
